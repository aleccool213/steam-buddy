# Steam Buddy

## About
Steam buddy is a small node bot that watches for Steam users to join a game. When a member starts playing a game, Steam Buddy sends a Slack message to the specified channel notifying all group members that there friend has begun playing a game!

## Todo
1. Break out some of the constants that are stored in plaintext
2. Clean up and modularize the code


## Future features
1. Allow users to open the steam game from the message
2. Allow easy addition of new steam users to watch
3. Allow easy configuration of steam users, steam games, and Slack channels
4. Upgrade to node 1.0.x
